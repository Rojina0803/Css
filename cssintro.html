    <p> This is paragraph-1.
        Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. 
        Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:
        a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. 
        In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
